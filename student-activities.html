                        <h2>Public Speaking Through Model United Nations</h2>
                        <p>“Being part of the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa’s Model United Nations (MUN) enrichment has been such a rewarding and eye-opening experience for me. If there is one thing I have learnt, it is that if you put your mind to something and truly believe in yourself, anything is possible. I can say with confidence that the person I am today is largely thanks to the Academy’s MUN enrichment.</p>
                        <p>Participating in many MUN conferences since Year 7 has given me the opportunity to interact with diverse individuals, thus allowing me to broaden my perspective. I have also developed great public speaking and debating skills. This led me to being recognised as the Best Speaker in the Human Rights Committee at the 38th East African Model United Nations in Nairobi. In addition, serving as the Secretary General of MUN at the Academy has taught me great leadership skills, teamwork, time management and strategic thinking. The support of our teachers, all of whom I am thankful for, has made this a very enriching experience.</p>
                        <p>Every skill I have learnt as a result of being part of MUN has contributed to me being an all rounded individual, which is relevant in every area of my life. Speaking in public has boosted my confidence and enhanced my communication skills. I am now able to articulate my points effectively, and share my thoughts and voice my opinion on matters I am really passionate about.”</p>

                        <p>“Being involved in the Aga Khan Academy Hyderabad’s enrichment programmes have helped me stand out as a student and as an individual. There are multiple opportunities offered to all students through these programmes, such as TEDx, which helped me unleash my true potential. I was the co-organiser for the 2019 TEDxYouth@AKAHyderabad and it is just one of the many things that I am involved in at the Academy. The TEDx community at AKA Hyderabad is more than a group of students and teachers. We work for months together and grow into a small family of our own, and being a part of this team has helped me grow in so many ways.</p>
                        <p>There were so many challenges thrown our way for this year’s event due to COVID-19. However, we learned to adapt to the hardships, overcome the challenges, break barriers and think far outside the box. This experience has enhanced all of my skills, made me a ferocious leader, an analytical thinker, and a student who is hungry for success and undertaking new challenges every day. I have had the honour of learning under the guidance of our TEDx teachers. These mentors, along with the entire TEDx family, have played a significant role in making me the responsible, independent, risk-taking, rational and hardworking citizen of the Academy that I am today. The Academy has helped me make notable accomplishments and stand out of the ordinary at the mere age of 17! I am very much looking forward to the next adventure I will take.”</p>

                        <h2>My Basketball Family</h2>
                        <p>“If someone told me I would be a part of the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa basketball team four years ago, I would have laughed. But reflecting on that statement now, I think to myself that my life would feel sort of incomplete without basketball in it.</p>
                        <p>Growing up as a competitive swimmer, the shift into the world of basketball was anything but easy. Each and every practice chipped away my pride and forced me to relearn myself as an athlete and as a person. Fortunately, I have supportive coaches and teammates who hold me accountable and keep pushing me to reach the potential they see in me. I am beyond lucky to be a part of a team that makes me feel like I’m a part of a family on and off of the basketball court.</p>
                        <p>I am also grateful for the facilities at the Academy that have allowed me to work on my craft, blow off some steam when I needed to or simply just play a game against a teammate. Each one of these things, along with the unity and lessons of teamwork from my coaches, continuously strengthens my love of basketball as a sport.</p>
                        <p>Basketball has also helped me develop skills that I can use in my academic and personal life. It has enabled me to see the importance of relationships, communication and strategy. I now find it easier to think on my feet, plan and communicate more effectively, which in turn has helped me to become well rounded in all aspects of my life.”</p>

                        <p>Every Saturday, my partner Tanya and I worked together to teach six to eight students at a local school reading, writing, speaking and listening in English. We had a girl in the class that could translate Portuguese to English for us and it was easier to communicate and teach the others through her help. We used games to teach them some basics such as greetings, different names of vegetables and fruits and some verbs.</p>
                        <p>The students wanted to have a debate between two groups in order to communicate better and listen to other points of view. We also had games such as guessing words in English. Sometimes the students would be the teachers for a minute and explain to us something new that they had learnt. The students were so friendly and they used to teach us words in Portuguese. They always understood that we as helpers did not know Portuguese and they were always encouraging us to learn more. I really loved that experience of community service and I feel like I want to meet the students again soon!</p>
