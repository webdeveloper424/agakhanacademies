                       <p>"Being a residential parent at the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa was my favourite thing to do during my time there. Every day was filled with loads of laughter, hugs and smiles from all students aged 10 to 18, regardless if they did not live in my residential block or were not a part of my assigned residential family. There are times throughout the experience where I felt more like an older sister to the students by providing them advice on school-related and non-school-related things, consoling them when they missed home, and just chatting about what was going on in our lives. There is really a strong sense of community throughout the residences that you immediately feel, especially during our Wednesday family dinners. When I am assigned for duty on the weekends, I feel the most connected to the residential students. We spend some time off-campus at the movie theatre, on a hiking trail, or the beach, but also on-campus when I am supervising the pool area or basketball court during our sports hour. I will also forever cherish the intimate moments I had with the residential students, especially laying outside on the grass in front of the residences on the weekends before dinner time with a few students. Overall, the residential programme makes you feel a part of a supportive family whether you're a student or a residential parent."  <Strong>- Anusha Lalani, (former) residential parent, AKA Mombasa</Strong></p>
                       <p class="mb-0">"My time within the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa residences have truly been an emotional rollercoaster. I have laughed, cried and anything else you could possibly think of. Being in the Academy’s residential programme has really given me a sense of belonging. From waking up each day and seeing everyone helping each other in order not to be late for breakfast, to ordering food when it's someone's birthday, the residences has brought out the spirit of family in each and everyone of us and made us feel secure and important, just like home. There are so many different activities are prepared for us on the weekends in order for us to bond with each other. Some activities include pool parties, mall outings, movie nights, and so much more. Frankly, the residences at the Academy is just like my second home because of all the love we all share as part of one community." <Strong>Gloria Kamajugo, Grade 9, AKA Mombasa</Strong></p>

                       <p>"As a new student to the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa, I was excited to be a residential student when I first came. I became a part of the best residential family a new student could ask for. My residential parent was so kind, loving and welcoming towards me and she guided me throughout the year. Being in the residences has given me an opportunity to become more independent and connect with a diverse community. My favourite part of the residential experience is the block bonding activities over the weekends. We would do activities such as sports, movie nights, pool parties, dance parties and more. These activities provided everyone with a time to hang out with each other and get to know one another better."<Strong> - Qaisara Yasin, Grade 10, AKA Mombasa</Strong></p>
                       <p>"As a residential student for the past four years, I cannot express how rewarding it has been for me as an individual. From the caring and warm-hearted dorm parents to the fun-filled bonding events to keep us active and busy, the residential life truly reminds me of home. On the weekends, we have bonding events that usually differ. My personal favourite is when we go off-campus to the mall and get a chance to shop, eat and spend quality time together with people who are in other blocks. With pride, I can say that my residential life is reminiscent of being at home with my family. Being in the residential programme has helped me become more independent, responsible and most of all pluralistic. I really enjoy being around people who are from different backgrounds to form one big family. To be frank, the Academy is like my second home because of the hospitality and love received from the entire residential community."<Strong> - Arya Noor, Grade 9, AKA Mombasa</Strong></p>

                                                <p>I have had to hit the snooze button three times but it’s 7 am and the day starts. After freshening up, I go room to room to ensure that everyone is awake. This is part of my duty as a dorm prefect at the Aga Khan Academy Hyderabad. After getting dressed for school, I register my name and timings at the entrance of the dorm and leave the dorms after waving farewell to our security guard, Ms Anna. My friends and I proceed to the dining hall for breakfast, talking about today’s classes.</p>
                                                <p>When school ends at 3.30 pm, I usually go for snacks in the Commons while talking about my day at school with my friends. I then go play volleyball, shower, drop off my clothes for laundry and head to the Commons for dinner around 6.50 pm. Once dinner is over, the dorm prefects and I rush to the kitchen to get the cookies the students in our dorms will have after study time at 7.30 pm, while also getting to taste a cupcake along the way! We quickly drop the cookies off at the dorms and go to the Commons for our own study time till 9.15 pm.</p>
                                                <p>Being a Diploma Programme student and a Dorm Prefect has been quite challenging for me, especially in the initial months. I found myself running behind on revisions and learning course material. However, I overcame those challenges by going for afterschool academic support and finding a balance between it all.</p>

                                            </div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>Time flies by and soon we head back to the dorms where we conduct the attendance for the night. Other dorm prefects and I distribute cookies. Everyone is talking and laughing at each other's jokes, making it very lively. Some of the residential students can feel homesick at times, which is understandable. We try to make sure they develop a sense of belonging to the campus and the residential community through different activities, like sports, music and art.</p>
                                        <p>After attendance, I go to my room to call my parents and work on any assignments or work I might have left to do before it’s lights out at 10.30 pm. I would say my favourite part about being a Dorm Prefect is the ability to hear the stories of others, which has made me more empathetic and grateful. I believe a responsible position is not about testing your leadership skills, but it’s more about your ability to listen and know your community. I have always been grateful for the residential life due to the sense of community and holistic growth that it has offered me in the past three years.</p>

                                                <h2>Dorm Prefect Duties at AKA Hyderabad</h2>
                                                <p>I have had to hit the snooze button three times but it’s 7 am and the day starts. After freshening up, I go room to room to ensure that everyone is awake. This is part of my duty as a dorm prefect at the Aga Khan Academy Hyderabad. After getting dressed for school, I register my name and timings at the entrance of the dorm and leave the dorms after waving farewell to our security guard, Ms Anna. My friends and I proceed to the dining hall for breakfast, talking about today’s classes.</p>
                                                <p>When school ends at 3.30 pm, I usually go for snacks in the Commons while talking about my day at school with my friends. I then go play volleyball, shower, drop off my clothes for laundry and head to the Commons for dinner around 6.50 pm. Once dinner is over, the dorm prefects and I rush to the kitchen to get the cookies the students in our dorms will have after study time at 7.30 pm, while also getting to taste a cupcake along the way! We quickly drop the cookies off at the dorms and go to the Commons for our own study time till 9.15 pm.</p>
                                                <p>Being a Diploma Programme student and a Dorm Prefect has been quite challenging for me, especially in the initial months. I found myself running behind on revisions and learning course material. However, I overcame those challenges by going for afterschool academic support and finding a balance between it all.</p>

                                                <img src="assets/images/about/image.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                                            </div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>Time flies by and soon we head back to the dorms where we conduct the attendance for the night. Other dorm prefects and I distribute cookies. Everyone is talking and laughing at each other's jokes, making it very lively. Some of the residential students can feel homesick at times, which is understandable. We try to make sure they develop a sense of belonging to the campus and the residential community through different activities, like sports, music and art.</p>
                                        <p>After attendance, I go to my room to call my parents and work on any assignments or work I might have left to do before it’s lights out at 10.30 pm. I would say my favourite part about being a Dorm Prefect is the ability to hear the stories of others, which has made me more empathetic and grateful. I believe a responsible position is not about testing your leadership skills, but it’s more about your ability to listen and know your community. I have always been grateful for the residential life due to the sense of community and holistic growth that it has offered me in the past three years.</p>
