                        <p>I love to teach and want to inspire and empower my students to excel in whatever they choose to do.</p>
                        <p>During my class, I prioritise teamwork, group work and peer work as well. All students must respect each other regardless of disagreements. As for training small leaders, the activities are designed so that each student takes action in the units. I always give students opportunities to become independent and look for solutions to overcome problems and obstacles. In my classes, each student contributes to the success of the group. </p>
                        <p>The Academy has made me a better instructor by giving me feedback on my teaching. It offers ongoing training courses to make teachers more effective and more successful. The day I graduated from the Academy’s Teachers Preparation Programme, I felt recognised for what I was doing and it made me aware of how important the training was and how important the teaching profession was. The Academy was placing great trust in me. And I had to work hard not only for myself, but for my students and for my country. That day was the beginning and not the end of a long journey.</p>

                        <h2>A Culturally-Engaged Community</h2>
                        <p>“From a very young age, I was drawn to India and Hindu mythology. I remember being about 9 years old and learning that a school friend was travelling to Sri Lanka; it wasn’t India but it was close. Ever the eccentric child, I begged my friend to bring me back a piece of the earth. I still remember the utter delight I felt in receiving her postcard and later, the twig she had picked up for me. I still have that postcard today, buried away in dusty boxes at my parents’ house. It was more than two decades later that I made my first solo journey to India, a celebration to mark the culmination of my PhD. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine being fortunate enough to find meaningful work there one day.</p>
                        <p>It was 2016 when I first learnt of the Aga Khan Academy Hyderabad. My life had taken a different course since leaving academia and I was then pursuing a Post-Graduate Diploma in Psychology of Education with a view to becoming a counsellor. What attracted me to the Academy was not only its location, but more importantly its ambitious social outreach programme. During my education in the United Kingdom, I had attended both private and publicly funded schools. I was not interested to work in the former and serve the minority exclusively. I was likewise drawn to the Academy’s vision of nurturing culturally-rooted citizens and immersing myself in a culturally engaged community as a result.”</p>

                        <p>“I joined the Aga Khan Academy Hyderabad in March 2012, before which I worked at the airport as a technical supervisor. There are so many reasons why I love working at the Academy; the clean air and complete lack of pollution make for a wonderful work environment. Beyond that, I really enjoy being able to interact with students and staff on a regular basis (most often when there is no hot water!). Everyone is always so polite and respectful when asking for help and it makes working so much easier. The students in particular are very kind-hearted.</p>
                        <p>COVID-19 definitely made my work more challenging, and as the person in charge of all the external check points at the school, I have felt very responsible for keeping our community safe.</p>
                        <p>These eight years at the Academy have been some of the best of my life and I hope to be able to work here for as long as I can!”</p>
