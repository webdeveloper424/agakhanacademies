                        <p>An Aga Khan Academies education prepares exceptional students to become thoughtful, curious, ethical and community-oriented leaders. The IB curriculum is enriched by the Aga Khan Curricular Strands of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ethics </li>
                            <li>Pluralism</li>
                            <li>Cultures (with an emphasis on Muslim civilizations) </li>
                            <li>Governance and Civil Society </li>
                            <li> Economics for Development</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Students combine their leadership development, responsibilities for others and service learning with critical thinking and academic rigour. Bilingual in English and at least one other national language, and accustomed to working and living with others from different national, cultural, religious and economic backgrounds, Academy graduates are prepared to take on the challenges of a complex and interdependent world.</p>

                        <p>“I wanted to be part of the Aga Khan Academy Hyderabad community back in 2016. I believed the Academy would expose me to a variety of curricular and extracurricular opportunities and experiences. Little did I know that after being accepted into AKA Hyderabad that my journey would go way beyond what I originally anticipated. </p>
                        <p> The Academy has provided me with a platform to thrive. Not only have I grown as a student, but also as a person. I've begun to take my roles and responsibilities as a global citizen more seriously. The diverse culture of the Academy allowed me to meet people from around the globe who are equally passionate about what they do. School has generated a sense of appreciation for community and service, a sense of gratitude towards the opportunities I have received, a sense of rumination for everything I am exposed to and a zeal for being a better person each day. </p>
                        <p>The International Baccalaureate curriculum offered by the Academy is rigorous yet unique and highly rewarding as it develops holistic learners. This goes hand in hand with the vision and mission of the Academy. Lifelong learners with a pluralistic mindset, moral reasoning and compassion are developed to enact change in the world around us. I consider myself fortunate to be a part of an institution that instills these values and characteristics in me and today’s youth. I am grateful to be able to still reap the benefits of the decision I made to attend the Academy four years ago.”</p>

                        <h2>Part of the Team</h2>
                        <p>“The Aga Khan has been a household name for me from a young age. Growing up, my grandfather would tell me stories about working at His Highness the Aga Khan’s stud farms in Ireland. When my cousins moved to Kenya and began attending the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa, I visited them several times. I always knew I wanted to end up living and working in Africa.</p>
                        <p>Walking to work in the freezing cold and rain in Ireland always made me long for Africa, so I made the decision to try and make the move. I searched online for job openings within the Aga Khan Academies and to my delight the Aga Khan Academy Maputo was looking for a Visual Arts Teacher. I was further drawn to the idea of working for the Academy due to the fantastic curriculum on offer. The International Baccalaureate strongly promotes pluralism, cultural enrichment, inclusion and leadership to create a better world for all. The Rebalancing Programme the Academy offers is also something I was very keen to learn more about and get involved with. Providing students from different socioeconomic backgrounds with opportunities to be educated in a phenomenal setting is very important. </p>
                        <p>I was ecstatic to receive my confirmation. I began working from Ireland due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions but have enjoyed every minute of it. The Aga Khan Academy Maputo is a hard-working family, the staff are fantastic and have made me feel like I have always been a part of the team and the students are phenomenal, engaging and dedicated. I will miss my family and friends when I move to Mozambique, but I am truly excited to begin this new adventure.”<p><Strong> Cinzia Torriani, second-year Diploma student, Mombasa</Strong></p>

                        <p>“My first impression of the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa was its impressive campus with excellent modern facilities from the classrooms, the astroturf, the swimming pool and the amphitheatre. </p>
                        <P>Both of my children have been enrolled at the Academy since Year 1 and we have experienced the school through different periods and transitions. and we can confidently state that the Academy is continuously well managed and welcoming to all. </p>
                        <P>Our principal reason for enrolling our children into AKA Mombasa was the International Baccalaureate curriculum, which has been excellently carried out. We saw how the Academy nurtures well rounded, independent students, equipped to take on the ever-changing modern world. </p>
                        <P>The teachers take a keen interest in every student and are easily approachable. Having been in the Parent Teacher Association, we find the Academy is always attentive to parents’ concerns. There is always an impetus to make positive changes - even lunch and dinner menus are discussed! </p>
                        <P>One thing that struck us was the Academy’s approach to pluralism and inclusion of all. Unlike other schools, there is no favouritism. We feel this is very important as all students should be treated equally. </p>
                        <P>The quality of the Academy is visibly evident when you attend the various school plays and events which are at par excellence. Several events are organised by the students themselves and attending these makes you feel proud. Choosing AKA Mombasa was the right decision for our family.”</P>
